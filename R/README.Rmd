## Overview

The EAgraphics package provides a suite of user-friendly functions designed to visualize data and indicators frequently utilized in Ecosystem Approaches (EA) to Fisheries Management.

Initially developed as a visualization companion to the Gulf of St. Lawrence Ecosystem Approaches (gslea) R package (https://github.com/duplisea/gslea), EAgraphics is built to be flexible. While it integrates seamlessly with gslea data structures, it is equally capable of visualizing any EA-relevant datasets that follow standard long-format conventions.

### Key Capabilities
-Publication-Quality Figures: Standardized plotting for physical oceanography (temperature, ice dynamics), biological metrics (phytoplankton phenology, zooplankton abundance), and fisheries data.

-Integrated Trend Analysis: Simplified implementation of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and annual trend lines to distinguish inter-annual variability from long-term ecosystem shifts.

-Bilingual Reporting: Full support for English and French outputs. Using internal dictionaries and the rosettafish package (https://github.com/pbs-assess/rosettafish), EAgraphics automatically translates species names, region identifiers, and complex scientific units. Translations will need to be added to internal dictionaries when new terms or areas are used, therefore contact the package maintainer to add these as necessary (Jacob.Burbank@dfo-mpo.gc.ca)

-Anomaly Visualization: Flexible functions for the computation and visualization of anomalies based on user-defined baseline periods, essential for identifying significant environmental departures.

-Fisheries Status Monitoring: Specialized heatmap visualizations designed to show stock status relative to Limit Reference Points (LRP), ensuring consistent stock ordering and clear threshold demarcations across languages.

## Why use EAgraphics?
Ecosystem Approach data is often multi-faceted and spatially complex. This package reduces the "coding overhead" required to produce consistent figures across multiple indicators. Whether you are comparing sea surface temperature across different Ecosystem Assessment Regions (EARs) or visualizing the status of multiple fish stocks simultaneously, EAgraphics ensures the output is standardized, reproducible, and ready for technical reports or peer-reviewed publications. Also in line with billinguial requirements in DFO Res Docs, this package provides the ability to translated plots to provide both english and french versions of all figures. 

## Installation

You can install the package directly from github and explore the functions:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("your-username/EAgraphics")
library(EAgraphics)
```

## How To Use
The following will walk through the use and functionality of each of the functions provided in the package which include: 

<u>plot_gslea_temperature(data, var, EARs, groups, ...)</u>

Visualizes temperature data (SST, bottom temperature, or depth-specific layers) from the gslea dataset or any ecosystem dataset. It supports bilingual labeling (lang = "en" or "fr") and can aggregate multiple Ecoregions (EARs) into custom groups (e.g., "Northern GSL"). You can choose to show annual trends with simple lines or apply a smoother (fit_smooth = TRUE) to help identify long-term climatic tendencies; while it defaults to a GAM, you can specify alternative smoothing methods and formulas to fit your specific statistical needs. For report-ready graphics, the text size is fully customizable via base_size, ensuring your plots stay legible.

<u>plot_gslea_ice(data, var, EARs, groups, ...)</u> 

Visualizes ice metrics (e.g., duration, maximum coverage, first/last ice) and seasonal phenology (e.g., start of warming or cooling at specific thresholds) from the gslea dataset or any ecosystem dataset. Like its temperature counterpart, it features full bilingual support (lang = "en" or "fr") and dynamic aggregation of Ecoregions. The function automatically detects the variable type to apply the correct units, whether it's Days, Day of Year, or Week of Year. You can visualize trends with simple annual lines or utilize a customizable smoother to identify long-term patterns, while adjusting the base_size to ensure all labels remain perfectly legible for publication.

<u>plot_gslea_plankton(data, var, EARs, groups, ...)</u> 

Visualizes lower trophic level metrics including phytoplankton bloom dynamics (start and magnitude) and zooplankton abundance or biomass (e.g., Calanus species, total dry weight) from the gslea dataset or other ecosystem datasets. This function is specifically designed to handle complex biological units—such as $10^3\text{ ind m}^{-2}$ or $\text{mg chla m}^{-2}$—automatically based on the variable selected. It offers full bilingual support (lang = "en" or "fr") and allows for the aggregation of Ecoregions into ecological groups. Users can display raw annual variability with connected lines or apply a customizable smoother to highlight multi-decadal shifts in the GSL food web, all while maintaining control over font sizes and color palettes for publication-quality output.

<u>calc_anomaly(data, baseline_range, year_range, quiet)</u>

A "pipe-friendly" utility used to transform raw observations into climatological anomalies. By providing a required baseline_range (e.g., c(1991, 2020)), the function calculates a long-term reference mean and computes the departure for every year in your dataset. It returns a focused, high-density data frame containing only the essentials: the year, the original value, the reference mean used, and the final anomaly. It includes built-in safety checks to ensure your baseline period actually contains data and, unless set to quiet = TRUE, will report the calculated mean to your console to ensure your "math is mathing" before you head to the plotting stage.

<u>plot_anomaly(data, value_col, composite_data, ...)</u> 

The flagship visualization tool for oceanographers to show environmental trends and standardized anomaly "scorecards." This function generates a two-part plot: a top bar chart showing annual departures from a baseline and a bottom heatmap scorecard that bins values into a standardized color scale (from deep blue for negatives to dark red for positives). It features clamping logic to handle extreme outliers without breaking the color scale, supports stacked bars for composite indices, and includes bilingual support (lang = "en" or "fr"). The X-axis is highly customizable via x_breaks_interval, making it easy to create legible plots for long time series.
